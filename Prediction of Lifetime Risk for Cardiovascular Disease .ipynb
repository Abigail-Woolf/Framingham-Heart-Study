    "The goal of this homework will be to analyze a paper and attempt to replicate the paper's model and findings. We'll be looking at **Prediction of Lifetime Risk for Cardiovascular Disease by Risk Factor Burden at 50 Years of Age**, which you can find [here](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.548206?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub\\%3dpubmed). The assignment will be broken down into two parts: 1) first, we'll be analyzing the paper's approach and methods, then 2) we'll attempt to replicate the findings. You are encouraged to complete all of the questions within the notebook, but if you would like to answer the written questions separately that is fine as long as you **submit all of your responses on Gradescope as 1 PDF and tag the pages appropriately**.\n",

If you need an extension for any reason, please reach out (no need to explain any personal details). Submission instructions are the same as for the previous homeworks and details are at the end of the notebook.\n",

Your boss has noticed that lots of people who receive the medication are still ending up with cardiovascular disease. With only a limited supply, she thinks this medication would be best reallocated to others who would benefit more. She tells you to look at the data and build a model to predict which patients would not benefit from the medication, as measured by whether they go on to have a bad outcome even though they were given the medication. To do this, you’ll fit a model of who goes on to have that bad outcome -- cardiovascular disease — among just the people who were on the medication. Those with high scores will go on to have a bad outcome. Those with the lowest risk scores are the people who would do well on medicaiton, so they are given the medication.\n",
